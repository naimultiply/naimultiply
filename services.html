                        <p class="policy-text">However, it's important to note that trusts managed directly by clients without our organization as the designated trustee will not benefit from the collective results, resources, and network advantages that come from being part of our managed trust ecosystem.</p>

By working with us as your trustee, you gain access to these benefits while maintaining control over your trust's specific objectives and distributions.</p>
